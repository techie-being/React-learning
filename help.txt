To create a react porject we have two methods 

* First, understand the difference *

React is a JavaScript library for building UI.

To use React, you need a build tool (to bundle, transpile JSX, etc.).

Earlier, the official way was Create React App (CRA). Now, people mostly use Vite, which is much faster.

So, React = library.
Vite = build tool (a replacement for CRA).

* why we use vite instead of react *

Speed ðŸš€

CRA is slow (especially when starting dev server or rebuilding).

Vite is super fast because it uses modern ES modules and builds only whatâ€™s needed.

Lightweight âš¡

CRA installs a huge amount of dependencies (~200MB).

Vite installs only what you need (~20â€“30MB).

Modern ðŸ†•

CRA is not actively maintained anymore.

Vite is modern, widely used, and has better plugin support.

Beginner friendly ðŸ‘¶

CRA feels "official" but is outdated.

Vite has simpler setup and better developer experience.
ðŸ‘‰ Even as a beginner, Vite is easier and faster.
