import Chai1 from "./Chai"   //imports "Chai" component from chai.jsx     .
function App() {
  
  return (
    <Chai1/>
  )
}


export default App  //export default app function to main .jsx  as same way as we expoerted chai component in app.jsx  .
//in jsx we can only return one element ,so if any situation ocuurs when we have to return multiple elements then we can use either div tag or "<>"" known as fragements in react.
